## üìñ Overview  

This project implements an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** that processes data about the largest banks in the world by market capitalization.  

The pipeline:  
1. **Extracts** raw data from a Wikipedia snapshot.  
2. **Transforms** market capitalization from USD to other currencies (`GBP`, `EUR`, `INR`).  
3. **Loads** the final dataset into both a CSV file and a SQLite database.  
4. Runs a set of **sample SQL queries**.  

Logging is also implemented to track progress at every stage.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ETL Pipeline

**Extract**:
Scrapes the table of the largest banks from a Wikipedia snapshot using BeautifulSoup.

**Transform**:
Reads exchange rates from a CSV file and converts market capitalization values from USD to GBP, EUR, and INR.

**Load**:
- Saves results into a CSV file (Largest_banks_data.csv).
- Loads data into a SQLite database (Banks.db).

**SQL Queries**:
Example queries executed in the script:
- SELECT * FROM Largest_banks;
- SELECT AVG(MC_GBP_Billion) FROM Largest_banks;
- SELECT Name FROM Largest_banks LIMIT 5;

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements  

This project requires **Python 3.8+** and the following libraries:  

```bash
pip install pandas beautifulsoup4 requests numpy
```

## üöÄ How to Run  

Clone the repository or download the script, then execute:  

```bash
python banks_project.py
```
